# KassonLab Nectriaceae
Nectriaceae genomes project with [Matt Kasson](https://www.davis.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/matthew-kasson) lab (WVU).

This archives the pipeline scripts for assembly using [AAFTF](https://github.com/stajichlab/AAFTF) and [funannotate](https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate). 
The log files from the runs are part of the archive and genome size estimates and BUSCO results.  See the [samples.csv](samples.csv) file for info on the samples 
and [asm_stats.tsv](asm_stats.tsv) for summary statistics.

Only strains/samples with sufficient sequencing depth and quality were carried forward in the analysis.
